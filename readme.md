## Hi, I'm Jana! Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

I am a **Computer Science undergraduate student** at Oakland City University with a minor in **Business Administration**. I am interested in building practical, well-structured solutions while developing skills relevant to **business technology, project coordination, and technology-driven decision making**. I enjoy learning how technical systems support business goals and how clear communication and collaboration contribute to successful outcomes.

I am self-motivated, detail-oriented, and committed to writing clean, efficient code while continuously improving my technical and professional skills.

## 🎓 Education

I am currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at **Oakland City University**, with a minor in **Business Administration**. I am a junior and expect to graduate in **2027**.

I completed the **first two years of my undergraduate education** at **William Carey University**, where my studies were more focused on **business-related coursework**, helping me develop strong communication, organizational, and analytical skills.

After transferring to **Oakland City University**, I shifted my primary focus to **Computer Science**, where I strengthened my programming, problem-solving, and technical skills. This combined background supports my long-term goal of pursuing a **Master’s degree in Business** while working at the intersection of technology and people.

## 🎯 Career Goals

I am interested in pursuing a career that combines **business and technology**, where I can apply my technical background while working closely with people. I am particularly drawn to roles that involve collaboration, communication, and elements of **public speaking or client-facing work**, such as business technology, project coordination, or technology-driven business roles.

I am actively seeking a **summer internship** where I can gain hands-on experience, contribute to real-world projects, and continue developing both my technical and professional skills.

## 🛠️ How I Manage My GitHub Projects

I use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. Below are the basic Git commands I commonly use to manage and update my repositories:

```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

# Check the status of files
git status

# Add changes to staging
git add .

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Update README and project files"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin main
```

These commands help me keep my projects organized, track changes efficiently, and maintain clean version history.
